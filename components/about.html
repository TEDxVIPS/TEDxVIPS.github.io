                    TEDx is a grassroots initiative, created in the spirit of TED’s overall mission to research and discover “ideas worth spreading.” TEDx events are independently organized under a free license granted by TED, bringing people together to share a TED-like experience. These local, self-organized events feature a combination of live presenters and TED Talk videos, designed to spark deep discussion, connection, and inspiration within local communities.
                    <span id="more-about-text" class="more-text" style="display: none;">The TEDx program aims to foster learning, inspire innovation, and provoke conversations that matter on a local scale, thereby extending the global impact of TED's vision. While TED provides general guidance for the TEDx program, individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized and operate independently, adhering to a framework that ensures a consistent, high-quality experience for attendees worldwide.</span>
